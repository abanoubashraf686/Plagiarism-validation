# Plagiarism Validation Project

## Overview
This project is part of the Algorithms Course. It focuses on optimizing the similarity graph generated by MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity) to enhance plagiarism detection. The primary objective is to identify connected components within the graph and construct a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) for each group. This process helps filter out redundant cycles and retain only the most significant matches, ultimately improving the efficiency of plagiarism detection.

## Algorithms Used
### 1. Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm is employed to find the maximum spanning tree by sorting all edges in descending order and adding them to the tree if they do not form a cycle.

### 2. Prim's Algorithm
Prim's algorithm starts with a single vertex and grows the MST by adding the most significant edge from the current tree to a vertex not yet in the tree.

## Time Complexity Analysis
The project includes a performance analysis of the two algorithms to compare their efficiency in constructing the MST. The analysis considers factors such as the number of edges and vertices in the graph.
